# 2023 USF Mathematics Research Seminar Series Data Science Project Activity
In Spring 2023, the USF Mathematics department held two research seminars for undergraduate mathematics students.
The research seminars introduced students to completing a data science project using Python.
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and dataset provided to participants to work on during the sessions.

## Source for the dataset
The dataset is the bike sharing data 'day.csv' (renamed as bike_sharing.csv) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, linked [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset).
